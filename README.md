# ETL-Pipeline-Project
An entire ETL pipeline , created to help a business transform their raw data into transformed, cleaned data to get more accurate data. This is done in an automated process on AWS, utilising lambda functions, s3 buckets, cloudformation templates, and then automatically sent to the redshift database, then uploaded to grafana.
